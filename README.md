# OperationalResearch

[Operational Research ](https://futurewebai.com/blogs/artificial-intelligence-for-operational-research)is a discipline that uses advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions. It involves the application of mathematical models, statistical analyses, and optimization techniques to solve complex problems in various fields, including logistics, finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. The primary goal of OR is to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance productivity.

Some of the popular algorithms for OperationalResearch are : 

1. Optimization (LP, MIP, Integer Programming)

2. Scheduling & Sequencing Algorithms

3. Simulation & Stochastic Modeling

4. Heuristics & Metaheuristics (GA, SA, ACO, PSO)

5. Forecasting & AI-Integrated Optimization
